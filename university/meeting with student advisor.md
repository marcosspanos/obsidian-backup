how to ask approval for 
https://vu.nl/en/student/elective-space/electives
minor consists of 30 points 
6 points for level 1 (first year course)
minumum 
12 points for year 2 or 3 
no similar courses for my bachelor
for minor requirements 

Max. 6 ect = level 100 first year courses
Min. 12 ect = level 300 third year courses 
Rest (12) ect = level 200/300 either second year or third year courses 

# other potential courses i could take:
need to take some courses which are different than courses i already took or about to take 
might need to get it approved by examination board or something like that

do some more research on this tmr and book another appointment with student advisor to talk about ideas i have
look into history minor for next year maybe
