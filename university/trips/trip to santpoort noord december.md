met up with atlas and we went to a forest near his house which was really nice 
the forest just kept going and going for a long time, would love to go there another time soon or to bos amsterdam which is closer 
also found out bos means forest which didnt know at all and its kinda surprising i didnt know this before
then we went to his house and we got some lunch for a bit, then we went to a thrift store where i got a purple tie which was really nice
