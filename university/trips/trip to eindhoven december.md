im thinking of getting some five guys because it has been so long since i have gotten some last time
need to get sashas violin as well 
the trip getting there was a bit underwhelming because it was basically night already by the time i will get there
was nice reading on the train though, havent done that in a while 
this has motivated for a while, its amazing when i am able to go outside and meet people and friends and have fun
was looking for some jobs on the train for eu positions

had five guys, it was as good as last time
was able to get all of sashas stuff and had a nice stroll around eindhoven which was really nice
was also able to see some old places like pink where i got the first edible which actually got me high 

was checked 3 times today which is a personal record for myself 
it is crazy they would check that much but they did
