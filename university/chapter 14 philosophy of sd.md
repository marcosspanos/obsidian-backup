# choosing names:
good names are a form of documentation as they make code easier to understand
bad names increase the complexity of the code as it makes it harder to understand what they do 
# create an image:
the goal of a name is to create an image in the mind of the reader 
a good name conveys a lot of information about the underlying entity 

# precise names:
good names are precise and consistent
the most common problem of names is that they are too generic or vague

if its hard to find a good name for a variable or method that creates a clear image of the underlying object then it might mean that the underlying object may not have a clear design

## name consistency 
there are 3 major requirements for this
1. always use the same common name for the given purpose
2. never use the common name for anything else other than the given purpose
3. make sure the purpose is narrow enough that all variables with the same name have the same behaviour
