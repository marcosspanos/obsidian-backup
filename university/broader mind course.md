**Me:** Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. To start, how do you personally define success?

**[Interviewee’s Name]:** Success means achieving my goals, I try to not set too many long term goals but instead set mostly many short term goals because this gives me the flexibility to change my goals when some new event happens in my life 

**Me:** Has your definition of success changed over time?

**[Interviewee’s Name]:** Absolutely. When I was younger, I thought success meant having a high-paying job and recognition. But over time, I realized that true success is about finding purpose, enjoying what you do, and maintaining meaningful relationships.

**Me:** That makes sense. Can you share an experience from your life that shaped this perspective?

**[Interviewee’s Name]:** My perspective was shaped during my university years when I was able to not only meet new people but also join organisations and host events. This forced me to go out of my comfort zone and allowed me to take more risks in my future. The life I am living right now would not be possible without that initial phase in university. 

**Me:** That’s really insightful. Now, let’s talk about failure. Are you afraid of failing?

**[Interviewee’s Name]:** I am but I have learned how to deal with the fear of failure and to prevent it from stopping me and letting me live my life how I want to. It is not as large as it once was but it is definitely still there

**Me:** Can you describe a failure in your life and how you dealt with it?

**[Interviewee’s Name]:** Of course. I once started a business that completely failed within a year. At the time, I felt devastated. But looking back, that failure taught me more about resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving than any success ever has.

**Me:** That’s really inspiring. Did you ask for help during that time?

**[Interviewee’s Name]:** Yes, and that’s one of the most important lessons I learned. I reached out to mentors and colleagues, and their advice helped me move forward. Failure feels isolating, but asking for help makes a huge difference.

**Me:** Do you think failure is important?

**[Interviewee’s Name]:** It is. Without failure you don't take any risks which means you are just living inside your comfort zone without exploring any of the possibilities outside of it. For me that is not a life worth living where I am only experiencing the safe without trying new things. For as long as I can remember I have always wanted to explore the world and find out my place in it. 

# assigment 3:
my superpower is patience 

**Setting:** A quiet, dimly lit room where the Inner Critic lurks in the shadows, whispering doubts. Suddenly, Patience enters, calm and composed, radiating a steady, reassuring presence.

**Inner Critic:** (mocking) Oh, look who’s here. Patience. Always late and always too slow. You got nothing done in the last year so I am not sure why you are still trying. 

**Patience:** (smiling) I see what you’re doing, but I won’t be rushed. Growth takes time. Success isn’t about speed—it’s about persistence.

**Inner Critic:** (scoffs) That’s just an excuse for failure. You keep waiting and trying but you won't achieve anything. There is no way you are able to change anything with the rate you are going. You will just be stuck. 

**Patience:** (calmly) But change is always happening, even if I can’t see it yet. Like a  tree doesn’t grow overnight, but its roots strengthen beneath the surface. I trust the process and I know eventually things will be different 

**Inner Critic:** (frustrated) But what about mistakes? What if you wait too long and miss your chance? What if people think you’re too slow, too indecisive?

**Patience:** Rushing will only lead me to make more mistakes. I believe being slow and steady will in turn allow me to have a more stable life in the end where I am happier. 

**Inner Critic:** (grumbling) But waiting is hard. It’s frustrating!

**Patience:** It is, but frustration is temporary. I don’t let it control me. I breathe, I reflect, and I trust that my hard work will pay off in the right time.

**Inner Critic:** (sighs) You make it sound so easy...

**Patience:** It’s not easy. But it’s worth it. And I won’t let your doubts stop me.
