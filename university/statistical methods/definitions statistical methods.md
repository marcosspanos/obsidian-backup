z# chapter 1:
## sample space:
^f62728
all possible outcomes we can get from an experiment
### events:
these are subsets of the sample space 
a single event is only one of the possibilities we have in the sample space 
## probability:
a function to assign probability to events in number from 0 to 1 
## sets:
^d8ed57
A set is a collection of things called elements
## de morgan law:

## distributive law:
^e1966d
![[Pasted image 20241101100816.png]]
## cartesian product:
^c50506
the product of 2 sets can be written as A x B and it is the set containing ordered pairs from A and B 
## cardinality:
^4dd436
the size of the set
this is important for differentiating between uncountably infinite sets and countably infinite sets
## functions:
^4156b2
a function maps elements from the domain set to another set called co domain
there is only one element which can be mapped from the domain to the co domain otherwise it is a map not a function
## random experiment:
^ddea1d
process of observing something uncertain
## sum rule:

## independent random variables:
^0c50a9
![[Pasted image 20241102161447.png]]
two variables are independent if the multiplication of the two probabilities are the same as the two events happening one after the other randomly 
## bernouli distribution:

## geometric distribution:

## binomial distribution;
^aa6189
![[Pasted image 20241102161615.png]]
## negative binomial(Pascal) distribution:
![[Pasted image 20241102161642.png]]
## poisson distribution:

## cumulative distribution function:
^c07a64
![[Pasted image 20241102225132.png]]
this is always non decreasing and is also right/left continuous since there is no gap in the values which it can take, sometimes the values are the same for a range of input values but there is always a value corresponding to an input value from 0 to the range of the input 

## expectation:
^7e2588
![[Pasted image 20241102225213.png]]
## law of unconscious statistician:

![[Pasted image 20241102225305.png]]
this allows us to get the expected value of a function quickly if used correctly 

## variance:

if differentiability does not work we must use a more general formula
