# law of large numbers:
average converges to expectations
expectation of the sample mean is given by $\frac{1}{n}\sum{n},{i=1}$

## expectation of the sample mean

this means the sample mean of the distribution is equal to 1/n times the true mean of the distribution

# central limit theorem:
rescaled average converges to the standard normal distribution

## conditions for the central limit theorem to work 
1. the data must be randomly selected 
2. the sample values must be independent 
3. the sample must be large enough

## clt might not work
1. if the sample is not large enough then the central limit theorem might not work 
2. if the values are not iid, (identically independently )
3. the underlying distribution is skewed or discrete

when we are using clt the sampling distribution should go lower and lower the more samples we are able to acquire if all the conditions are met
