# origins of object orientation
 SIMULA is regarded as the first language to be object oriented 
 it was used to develop simulations 
 object orientation has become the most important software development paradigm 
 in 1980 and 90 the world was flooded with multitude of modelling languages
 the models of different project partners were often not compatible 
 this was referred as the method war 
 the object management group called for a specification of a uniform modelling language
 the objectives were 
 1. use of object oriented concepts to represent complete systems rather than one part of the software
 2. establish of an explicit relationship between modelling and executable program code
 3. creation of a modelling language that can be processed by machines 

## usage:
uml is not tied to any specific software or a specific target platform 


## diagrams:
a model is represented graphically as a diagram 
this provides a view of part of the reality of the model 
there are also models which represent supporterd and forbidden processes 


### class diagram:
this originated from the conceptual data modelling and object oriented software development 

it is based on the concepts of a class generalisation and association 

### object diagram 
this shows a concrete snapshot of the system state at a specific execution time 
### package diagram:
this groups diagrams or model elemtents according to the common properties
