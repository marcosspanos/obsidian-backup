# secram 
this is a risk management system developed by sesar 
## impact assesment
- identification of primary assets
- assesment of potential impact of a sucessful attack on the primary assets supported by operational impact scenarios

## risk assesment
- identification of the supporting assets derived from primary assets
- identification of threats targeting the supporting asseets
- identification of the vulnerabilities allowing the realization of these threats
- establishment of a risk evaluated classification of the threat scenarios targeting the supporting assets based on the likelihood and teh impact of those threat scenarios
- establishment of a list of additional controls to be achieved to address security risks


## risk treatement 
- selecting management options to address identified risks and iteratively calculate the residual risk 

the classification schemes (CIA criteria , likelihood and impact /risk ) are all useddc by OFAS
the assets identified and evaluated by each OFA should be shared via security registers across the organisation in order to have a consistent definition and evaluation of shared assets

# risk identification:

## asset identification:
primary assets
	intangible => information and services which are of value to OFA and it wants to protect
	a successful attack would have an impact on the ATM system
supporting or tangible assets
	entities which enable the primary assets
	they possess vulnerabilities which are exploitable with the aim to impair primary assets


## primary asset identification and impact assesment
services
- services which loss or degradation make it impossible to carry out the business mission of the OFA
- services that contain secret processes involving proprietary technology 
- services that if modified can greatly affect the accomplishment of OFA
- services that are necessary for the OFA to comply with contractual legal or regulatory requirements
**information**
- vital information
- personal information 
- strategic or confidential information 
- high cost information whose gathering storage and processing require a long time or involve a high acquisition cost


# threat scenario
## threat
combination of an attacker with own resources motivation and goal regardless of existing security measures existing in OFA 
the threat is the potential cause of an unwanted incident which may result in impact for OFA
