## topological sort:
we use this to make sure that any dependencies we have are met before we continue to the next step 
topological sort is not unique but it can have many ways to achieve a sort as shown below

# general notes
the difference between edmond karp and ford fulkerson is that edmond karp uses breadth first search to find the maximum flow path instead
