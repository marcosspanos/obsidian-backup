# modelling real world problems:
this can be useful when we want to find solutions using graph theory
a lot of algorithms will be quite slow so we will need to optimise them before we are able to find the best solution 


## techniques to use:
1. split formalisation and algorithmics
2. Iterate until you fsind an algorithm which has a better running time 
3. Use multiple known algorithms as pieces of your solution
4. Look for patterns
