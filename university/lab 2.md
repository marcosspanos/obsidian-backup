# class diagram
it models the attributes, operations and relations of the classes within the project

## class relations:
- multiple classes can relate to each other
- multiple types of relations
	- association
	- aggregation
	- composition
	- inheritance

# uml to java
- attributes become fields
- operations become methods
- relationship depends
# package diagram:
java has packages which correspond to file system directories
uml package diagrams display packages that group model elements

- import indicates the functionality of a class or package is included in another package
## approaches for packaging
by layer-> organise packages according to the types of classes and their technical responsibility
- easy to understand
- difficult to isolate change
by feature-> organises packages to their domain related functions
- good at isolating change
- hard to understand
