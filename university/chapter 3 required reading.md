# features scenarios and stories

there are 3 major factors which drive design of software products
1. business and consumer needs 
2. dissatisfaction with existing business or consumer software products
3. changes in technology which make new types of product possible 

there are many techniques developed to understnad potential users of your product 

user stories are a short description of what a user wants 
they require a feature and how the feature would work in theory


## personas:
finding who are the target users for your product is very important 
you need to have some understanding of potential users to design features which they will find useful 

personas are about imagined users 
different personas will help to make sure you consider all possible aspects for someone using your product 

there is no standard way to represent a persona

usually 5 personas are enough to identify the key features of a system

## scenarios:
your product features need to tempt users to switch over

this is how to create a potential scenario 
the idea of scenarios has been used since 1980's


### writing scenarios:
you should start scenarios with the personas you have created. 
there should be more than one scenario per persona usually 
they should always be written from the personas perspective and should be based on identified personas or real users



## user stories:
these are finer grain narratives that set out in a more detailed and structured way a single thing that a user wants from a software system


user stories are not intended for planning but for helping with feature identification 

you should avoid negative stories for product backlog features. 
you should write negative stories which are meant for an absolute constraint for the system 


### user stories vs scenarios:
1. scenarios read more naturally because they describe what a user is actually doing with the system 
2. when interviewing real users they dont talk in a stylized way that is used in user stories
3. scenarios provide more context than user stories such as what the user is trying to do or how the user is working



# feature identification:
the ideal user identifiation is for features which are 
1. independent-> should not depend on how the other system features are implemented 
2. coherent->they should be linked to a single item of functionality. they shouldnt do more than a single thing 
3. relevance->they should reflect how users normally carry out some task 


![[Pasted image 20250322192205.png]]
these are the important factors in a feature set design 
1. simplicity and functionality--> software should be simple and functional. it is impossible to make it both at the same time so there must be a balance between the two
2. familiarity and novelty-> users want to have the same tasks they were doing with the other product they were using but if you only implement the features of that product they wont switch to your product so there must be some new features
3. Automation and control -> there is a fine balance between automating too much and giving users control so they can decide how they want to automate some things on their own 

something you should avoid is feature creep where number of features grows exponentially when the new potential users are envisioned 
feature creep adds to the complexity of the product 
feature creep happens for 3 reasons
1. product managers and marketing executives discuss the functionality . different users have slighty different needs and there is reluctance to say no to important users so all features are implemented
2. competitive products are introduced with slighty different features to your product. there is marketing pressure to include similar features so market share is not lost this can lead to feature wars
3. the product tries to support both experience and inexperienced users. easy ways of implementing common actions are added for inexperienced users while more complex features to accomplish the same thing are retained because experienced users prefer to work that way


## feature list:
the output of the feature identification should be a list of potential features 
there are many ways to describe features 
you can use user stories or scrum methods to describe them 

the product development team should meet to discuss user stories and the initial list  could be written on a whiteboard
this could also be done web based applications but this is less effective than face to face meeting
the feature list should then be recorded and shared in a document such as google sheet or jira 

scenarios and user stories should always be the initial point of identifying features for the product 
although they are useful they might not be all you need as users change their ways of doing tasks in the future 
it is also important to think creatively about alternative or aditional features that help users to work mroe efficiently 


# key points:
- software product -> fragment of functionality that implements something in a user might need
- first stage of product development -> identify product features
- personas are important for product development
- scenario is a narrative which describes a situation where a user is accessing a product to do something they want to do 
- user stories may be used to extend and add detail to a scenario
