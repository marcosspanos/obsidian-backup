# rapid application development
## objective 
- produce useful software quickly 
- based on prototyping


## main idea
- software is developed in a series of increments
- each increment provides a new functionality 

this is an alternative to the waterfall method which emerged in 1980 and 1990 

## characteristics
- specification design and implementation are interleaved
- software is developed as a series of versions with stakeholders involved in version evaluation 
- user interfaces are often developed using an ide and graphical toolset

## agile method
- reduces overhead in the software process 
- respond quickly to changing requirements
- practical quidelines
	- focus on code
	- iterative approach 
	- deliver working software quickly 
	- evolve software quickly to meet changing requirements

# plan driven vs agile driven 
## principles of agile 
1. customer involvment
2. incremental delivery 
3. people not process
4. embrace change
5. maintain simplicity 


this is suitable for smalal or medium sized teams
there needs to be a clear commitment from the customer to be involved in the development process for this to work 


## issues
- keep the interest of the customer invlolved 
- keep the team members in collabaration in the development process
- prioritize changes in the presence of multiple stakeholders
- maintain simplicity 


## extreme programming
- takes an extreme approach to iterative development
	- new versions might be build multiple times a day 
	- increments are delivered every 2 weeks


# user stories
these are informal general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user 
its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer



# scrum:
this is a framework based on agile principles
there are three phases 
1. initial phase 
2. sprint cycles
3. closure phase



## sprint
- short time boxed period 
- may last 1- 4 weeks
- an iteration in scrum 
- the team completes a certain amount of work 

### key elements
- roles
	- owner 
	- scrum master
	- developers
- scrum artifacts
	- product backlog
	- sprint backlog
- scrum events
	- sprint
	- sprint planning 
	- daily goal

the team is able to organise themselves to develop the software
the communication to the customer is done through the scrum master 

there are short daily meetings where all team members discuss their progress and any problems have showed up 

this allows all other team members to be able to adapt if there are any problems in other pieces of the software



# plan driven vs agile
most processes use plan and agile development
