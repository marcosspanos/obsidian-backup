## feature creep:
this happens mostly for 2 reasons. 
- product managers and marketing executives discuss the functionality they need with a range of different products 
- competitive products are introduced with slighty different functionality to your product
- 
# uml modes:
class diagrams is the most popular form of structure modelling and uml model 
## class
a construction plan for a set of similar objects of a system
1. class name
2. attributes
3. operations 

## binary association 
### navigability 
it shows which classes can see other ones
being shown with an arrow
### multiplicity:
number of object associated with each other
this is shown with a number on top of the lines
many is represented with a star
### roles
describes the way in which an object is involved in association relationship 

### aggregation:
1. transitive
2. assymetric 

used to express that a class is a part of another class

two types of aggregation;
1. shared aggregation -> part can also exist independently (client of different restaurants at the same time. weak dependency) 
2. composition->parts can not exist independently(one part can only be contained at one specific point in a time )
the diamond should be close to the whole part 
the diamond being filled means composition

## generalization-inheritance:
there is no need for multiplicity for inheritance at least for now 

# random notes:
there are  many different ways to represent a model
