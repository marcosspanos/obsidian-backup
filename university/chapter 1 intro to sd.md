# software design:
the construction of abstractions of data and computing and the organisation of these abstractions into a working software application 
it is almost impossible to find the optimal solution to software engineering problems, there are many reasons for this 
1. not all possible solutions are known and in many cases they might be infinite
2. estimating to what extent a design decision fulfills a given quality attribute is a very approximate process

design is a very heuristic process 
it consists of iterative problem solving guided by experience, general principles and design techniques

one of the most important goals of software design is to decrease the complexity of software which means making the software easier to understand 
## design in the software development process
there many different development processes for software development 
different processes offer different approaches for doing things reasons. 

an important part of software design is iteration 
when searching for optimal solution it is common practice to iterate over various alternatives 
this is also done in a bigger scale in that software development as the design of the system might periodically be extended and or improved 
improving the design of the code without changing the functionality is called refactoring 
there are many reasons why we want to refactor the code 
sometimes when we need to fix something quickly we implement a fast solution but this is not the best because this will lead to tech debt 
if allowed to accumulate tech debt will threaten the viability of the project


## capturing design knowledge
a design is a collection of decisions each of which is the result of a search process through a design space for a solution 

### unified modelling language
this is a modelling language organised in terms of different types of diagrams intended to illustrate different aspects of software 
not all development teams use UML but those who do might use it for different purposes
UML is used to focus on illustrate a single main idea and only include the relevant information 


## sharing design know-how
it is not easy to capture how to do some steps 
### design patterns:
reusing elements for object oriented designs was captured in the concept fo a design patter in the book design patters elements of reusable code 
the most useful skill to develop is to know when to use design patterns
