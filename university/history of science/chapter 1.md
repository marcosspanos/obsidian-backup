# eniac:
in 1980 historians agreed that the eniac was the first computer which fit a lot of the requirements modern computers have 
these are electronic which make it different from electromechanical computers who worked a lot slower 
also eniac was also general purpose which meant that the sequence of operations was not built into the hardware so it could be reprogrammed to carry out other tasks as well 

even before the eniac was finished design work had started for its successor called the edvac

eniac fixed the public impression on what a computer looked like and what it could do 
this was the first computer many people saw and even less people could actually use it 
## programmability
eniac wasnt the first programmable computer but it was the first to be able to decide automatically what to do after it was done with the job it was assigned


## design and construction
eniac was designed by John Maunchley 
he went to a special summer school for electronics 
there was a need for fast calculations for the war because guns were not even tested before being deployed 
eniac had a special problem, it was too fast for paper tape so the engineers needed to find a new way to supply information to it 
dozens of people worked on eniac 
many people had to help for eniac to succeed 
## eniac in use
by the time eniac was done the war was over 
it required 2000 square feet to work
eniac required operators all the time. these are remembered as the women of eniac. they were also accompanied by the scientist who was doing the calculations
# edvac:
the edvac was the second model of the eniac 
it had some major differences such as a different type of memory called the delay line instead of vacuum tubes eniac used

## von neuman 
a new member joined the eniac team 
he described logical structures instead of of specifics of hardware
coded instructions would be placed in the same place as the main memory which held data
this set edvac apart from other computers
another shift was that 

the edvac had 3 major paradigm shifts 
1. edvac specified an all electronic machine with a large high speed memory using binary number storage
2. von neuman architecture
3. system of instruction codes. It represented each instruction with an operation code followed by parameters or an address 

all these ideas were influential in the early days of computers
the biggest challenge in the early days was producing a stable memory able to hold thousands of bits long enough to run a program 


## programming tools:
rewriting all the code even for functions which are consistent across programs was a waste of time
this lead to people reusing old code which they called subroutines and keeping them in a paper tape library so they could be reused by others as well 

the arrival of symbolic and macro assemblers in 1950 made assembling code less tedious
this let programmers use labels instead of memory addresses which eliminated the need to edit the code every time locations changed


## association for computing machinery 
this was founded in 1947 for the exchange of information and ideas between those working in the computer technology field

it eventually grew into a society of a hundred thousand members 

## commercialization of computing
