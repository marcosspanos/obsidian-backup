# data centers and the cloud:
early companies relied on expensive servers 
eventually big websites outstripped the capabilities of a single server so companies set up farms of servers and load balancing algorithms to deal with the site 

## google 
google had another approach instead, 
instead of using a few high powered servers it would use a lot of cheap computers 
google achieved reliability using an extra layer of software
when google grew to a multinational company it kept this model where it used many cheaper parts instead of one high speed computer to achieve the same result 
this approach was called cloud computing 
it hid all energy use and human labor behind this term 

## cloud computing:
major companies like ibm microsoft and amazon developed large scale cloud services so that companies could sign a contract to have the company email on custom web applications 

companies before had to pay for disaster plans and it support, if they used cloud computing the cloud providers could share the costs among many companies instead 
this allowed for reduced costs both from companies which required disaster plans but also from companies who were supplying distaster plans since they could share the costs between many companies

## multiple core processors:
moores law was coming to a limit around 2000 when the clock speed of processors was coming to some hard physical limits 
this meant that new processors would need to find a nexw way to increase their performance
this eventually lead intel to add another processor on their chip 

graphics cards have thousands of cores in them 

## virtualization:
while many computers could act as one computer the opposite was also true 
one computer could act as many computers 


## streaming video:
more processor and network bandwidth is spend transmitting and decompressing videos than any other task worldwide 
netflix does not run any servers since 2016, all the netflix servers are hosted by amazon web services 

## social media:
the model for a lot of early sites was friendster.org 
by 2005 myspace had taken over, which was customizable and had animated graphics 
### facebook:
it began in 2009 and overtook myspace quite quickly 
it became the glue holding together the lives of a lot of its more heavy users 
it changed a lot over the years, in 2009 it was a platform for building applications 

## advertising:
almost all of the worlds most visited websites were supported by advertising 
wikipedia is a company which has not had advertisments in the site 

## applications head for the web:
the first push to turn web browsers into interactive online applications was made in mid 90s 
they wanted to write a program once run it anywhere
companies rushed to add java support to their devices 
java could turn windows personal computers irrelevant if it didnt matter what operating system it was running 
the cost of personal computers dropped while the network speed of many houses was too slow for them to use network computers 
this meant that it didnt work in the customer department
while on the business department microsoft started building administration abilities so the it would be able to control all devices at once and roll updates manually 

### software service:
a company would get a subscription to an application and then access it through the web browser
this was successful because it allowed workers to work from anywhere and they only needed a browser which they could use from their phone 


## ajax interactions:
in the late 90 there were 2 approaches for web based applications
one was a fast loading html site while the other one was an interactive java applet that could respond immediately but would be slower to load 
in late 1995 a third way appeared with netscape and javascript 
t was clunky and very buggy 
by mid 2000 new ways to use existing technologies to create more complex were being discovered 
the key was to pull new data without reloading the whole website 
this combined javascript with xml a data formatting method(Ajax)

## online office applications
google docs was the first widely used online suite 
the features were limited in the beginning 
the systems are generally free because most are supported by advertising or premium features behind a paywall 
browsers got extensions which were small pieces of code able to perform specific tasks 

## chrome and chromebooks:
a small team of firefox developers within google started creating a new browser 
by 2012 chrome overtook internet explorer 
academic institutions loved the cheap replacement for laptops called chromebooks
they offered an easy way to manage lots of devices and the users data was securely kept with google instead which made it a lot easier for backing up and making sure that data was safe

## new programming systems:
some new languages have joined server side of many applications(python ruby )
they are general purpose languages 
the choice of a language is not as important anymore, the most important choice is choosing a framework which bundles together commonly used features to make creating a site easier 
even though websites have become increasingly complicated making a website has become easier because a lot of the building blocks are already there and this allows for one developer to create a website by reusing a lot of the same parts from other websites
this allowed for faster development of new websites
