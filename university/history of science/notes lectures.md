# cold war science:
the original machines didnt work that well 
they would work for a couple of hours but then need maintenance for a couple of days
the ideals are the reason that the computer is the machine that it is today 

many countries were trying to become more western
they collected statistics using ibm machines but after the war this wasnt possible so they started creating their own machines

most countries succeded creating their own computer outside of the us and the uk 

## reasons:
- manhattan project
- aeronautical calculations 
- radar 
- code breaking (uk)
- supplying troops

radar technology was a big reason delay lines were used 
linear programming problems were used to supply troops

## after ww2
nasa needed more power for calculations (space race)
rebuilding the nation needed some calculation power as well marshal plan

fatalism -> heating up between eastern and western blocks
continental europe was afraid of cold war heating up 


they wanted to improve dutch society using computers /socialist ideals democratic socialism 

some french people were very anti us 
jean jackque servan 
le defis american/ american challenge
he wanted to build european computers 

europe and japan were ready to move into the computer age
relays were cheap

# dutch dinosaurs:
dutch had a lot of human computers for space program
this was also used for land reclamation works/ water works

deltar 
it was being used till 1972 
some analog machines were long being used after the digital computers became reliable 


at the beginning everyone use/d the computers for specific calculations even though they were general purpose

computer people were most mathematicians
machines like eniac cost millions

arra was the first dutch computer 1952 
which produced a random number
bluffing their way into the computer age

there some companies in netherlands which were already in agreement with ibm they could have built computers but couldnt . this didnt allow philips to massproduce computers


the original machines didnt work that well 
they would work for a couple of hours but then need maintenance for a couple of days
the ideals are the reason that the computer is the machine that it is today 

they created the pascal and stevin 

## vienna 
they were also manufacturing computers

all computers had cool acronyms
none were called computers
their names were supposed to make them more exciting (MIRACLE)

## public:
they didnt really a lot of computers 
they knew about automation but they could learn about about some basic stuff they could learn about them 
there were books and movies they could learn from 
brave new world -> dystopian literature
metropolis 1927 

1984 didnt have any computers in it at all 


# lecture 3
ibm was changed out of business by 1970 80 
## computing sounds:
noise was being used to play songs like god save the queen 
relays click(appropriation) 
on MIRACLE they played the dutch national anthem 

1950 had no screen so they couldnt check what the machines were doing 
this allowed technicians to check what they were doing 

when transistors computer became silent they added a speaker to add the sound back 

all of them had speakers to allow technicians understand what was happenign 
there was also a record for this

some people started creating music with computers 
## metaphors:
program 

had to keep track where flip flops to make sure that programs run the way you wanted 

appopriating the machine started with the arrival of new machines 
programming
programming used as a verb in 1948 

ferranti mark I was british 
people started testing what they could program and showed of what they could program

**metaphor**
pseudo coding 
automatic coding 
autocoding autocoding systems
memory 

programming was the metaphor that stuck around

coding was what they did from the beginning


bolter 
defining technology 
the computer became a defining technology -> it started define how we operated 

we speak as we are computers
wipe our hard drive when we forget
reboot->sleep 

after computers the difference between us and computers were that we are able to feel 

## ai:
they had a feeling of what the brain could do and they wanted to implement it in computers(cybernetics)


## ibm and european dwarves
general electric 
univac was rising 
it was bought by ibm
burroughs did well. they competed with ibm although they were dwarved by ibm

most companies couldnt compete with the scale of ibm and their support by the us goverment

### european dwarves:
philips 
odhner competed with ibm 

some companies didnt believe computers would be a thing and they lost the gamble 
especially in europe

the way to compete with ibm was to find a niche to fill 
general computers were dominated by ibm 

## france
bull created gamma 3 and gamma 60 
they were helped by the french goverment 

# lecture 4:
## metaphors dissapear:
there was an attempt to create a universal language
esperanto was one such attempt 

all these languages were metaphors for computers
all metaphors become so common they are no longer a metaphor

## agenda:
selling machines
adacemic discipline
thinking machines

connect worlds together at&t
telstar satelites

different groups of people have different agends
they all wanted to create better machines
agendas dont contradict others 

biology was involved in cybernetics(artificial intelligence) margaret mead
psychologists were intrested in what is intelligence

realtime computing was an agenda at some point 
some people didnt see the reason for real timecomputing 
pdp->programmable data processing

real time computing was really important for the army
cash dispenser 1967 
cashless society (make cash something that is theoretical) 

real time computing was important for cashless society 
atm and visa 1974 

d day decimal day feb 15 1971 
it wasnt possible to create a real time computer so they created an on time computer 

real time computing was also used in food 


## programming languages 
people started thinking of autocoding 
program started from flowchart 

### algol:
- elegant
- universal 
- satisfies european sense of clarity and order 
- academic 
- not flexible (better in theory than practice)
- difficult to learn
there was difference between european agendas and us agendas



there were many different agendas to create a universal language this didnt allow one universal language to exist 

## programming:
rise of software industry 

1960 
game designers arise in 1969 
the code wasnt called software but just code

software became soft and ware 
machines didnt come bundled with the software you needed to get it separetly 
software was something you could sell 
there was a software rise and a software crisis 
problem with growing amount of code
ibm felt this crisis 

# chapter 5
silicon valley started in the 1996
there was a lot of venture capital to support computer technology
windows and apple 
the story before apple and windows
they worked in another company before they started their own company 
they had connections to succeed
there were hundreds of companies which failed completely 


stewart brand 
whole earth catalog 
there was a picture of the earth from space

a lot of european cities tried to create their own silicon valley
both dutch and french tried this
both failed at first but they did work in the end

visicalc
a lot of people were being introduced to computers
goverments attempted to stimulate growth 

a lot of people had a computers because they were impressive 
## rise of the internet
there were a lot of local networks by companies and universitiers
in europe the world wide web took off 1990 

digital city was a really early social media
there was a chat box 
companies could present themselves 
de digital stad 
it wasnt really a thing outside of amsterdam 
a really early internet project

# lecture 6:
## computers in education
they were in the educational process
- in the classroom 
- computers in the textbook

binary arithmetics
flow charts
they needed to know what computers were able to do 

learning abilities-> finding out how it works
trying to meet the needs all individual pupils
but also meeting the need of teachers

goverments wanted students to become more educated 
prevent ww2 again

 they wanted to see if it was the same way that computers learn as people learn

there was also conditional branching as well 

computers were rare so classes like that were uncommon 

a lot of companies funded computer rooms so students were able to try the computers out
1980's

## change in movie culture
going digital 
	storage celluloid magtape dvd streaming

the themes changed as well 
they started involving computers 
the computers were subjects of the movies as well they were able to do stuff


special effects are all becoming themed with computers


## three traditions:
1. administration
2. process control 
3. science

## digital culture:
things change 
what changed in the last decade
1. data driven
2. changed how we look at the world

they changed social media into what they wanted 

knowledge society 
information cant be objective
we choose what information is shown in studies. we choose which variables are shown 
some attributes are chosen for a specific reason 

risk society 
there was information society 
knowledge society 
risk society-> the end of the cold war didnt have the expected result and instead it lead to more proxy wars around the world from the us
