# specialized mobile devices:
in the early 2000 people who were into computers needed to carry a lot of handheld computers with them 
during late 80 electronic address books and diaries was another use for a handheld computer 
one of the first usable electronic handhelds was the **Psion Organizer II**
it looked like a calculator and had a two line lcd display above a small keyboard

## pen computers:
a big problem of tiny computers was the keyboard 
a pen could be used to replace a mouse instead 
the most promising of the early systems was the apple newton launched in 1993 
the newton was marketed as a companion for conventional computer use 
to use it users entered text freehand and the device would use the hand recognition software to guess matching words although this was implemented very poorly 
later iterations of the newton would be more polished and would have better handwriting recognition
by that point a cheaper alternative had appeared, called the palm pilot 
palm required users to write one character at a time in a specific point on the screen-> this made text entry reliable 
a palm device had to be regularly synced with a windows computer to synchronize appointments,contacts and email 
## cellphone pagers and beepers:
cellphones arrived in 1980 they connected to a nearby ground station shifting around while the user was also moving through the city 

the first cellphone to go on sale was from motorola and weighed almost 2 pounds
by the end of 1980 the cellphone shrunk and were easily able to fit on bell holsters 
this technology also worked for pagers

2g networks worked digitally which improved security battery life and used the radio spectrum more effectively 

cellphone technology converged with computer communication in early 2000 
some had modems for wireless internet use but second generation phones were already digital this let them send data at speeds comparable with land line modems 

new phones spread fast because of the pricing mechanism 
users would get a new phone every 2 years but they would be locked with their telephone provider 

some second generation phones which were more powerful were seen as a handheld computer 
many phones could even run java programs as well as many other programs


## gps 
some cars started having computers inside them 
this allowed them to help users navigate streets using gps 
the system was designed by the us military 
the us military also developed a lot of other technologies which were used by many users across the world such as arpanet and others
they had some bandwidth reserved for thes
the car navigation system eventually trickled down to normal cars 
most were made by tomtom or garmin which made the paper atlas obsolete 

# iphone:
apples attempt to get into smartphones seemed rushed at first but it eventually wiped out all existing smartphones before it 
the key was getting rid of the buttons and replacing all the buttons with a giant screen 
there were tradeoffs but users were fine with teh tradeoffs being made which propelled the iphone into global stage
the first iphone was originally made with at&t wireless and started at 500 with a two year contract to pay 60 euros for service 
the second iphone sold more than a million units on the first weekend
## app store:
originally job wanted to control what users were able to do with the iphone and which apps they could download 
on the second iphone they introduced the app store 
many quickly migrated their apps to the app store 

the app store gave small groups a chance to distribute their software to a large amount of users
the app store provided an official way to pay for apps which made it a lot safer than online payment methods since apple was a trusted company by that point 
this allowed small 
## mobile cloud:
iphones had almost constant access to the cloud 
some applications run entirely on the cloud and only the user interface had to fit on the phone 
combined with gps this paved the way for entirely new businesses such us opentable a reservation app which allowed restaurants and customers to check which were available and book a table online
this also lead to tinder and grindr 

this also gave rise to uber an alternative to taxi service 
this made it all easier because booking an uber, paying for the uber could all be done on the smartphone 

there were many companies which promised to become the new uber for many services although none really survived 

## voice controlled assistants:
in 2011 the iphone launched focused on a new feature called siri which was a digital assistant meant to help the user 
when users asked questions siri searched for the information online 
digital assistants started showing up in other places as well such as amazon's alexa 
amazon priced them aggresively and this in turn created a big user base which demanded apps to be created to fill this gap 

## iphone wins:
the iphone destroyed many companies as well as whole product categories
	nokia and blackberry were completely wiped out 
the market for gps navigation boxes began to collapse 
the iphone also shrank the market for hand held game consoles from Nintendo and sony 

## tables:
apple soon came up with a new product called the ipad which was an iphone with a much bigger screen 
it was a huge success as well 
the second model of this was also a huge success 
the sales of the ipad peaked in 2014 and have been dropping ever since 
the ipad pro reattempted to revive the demand for ipads

# smartphones evolve:
the only real competitor for the iphone was android 
it was a startup in 2003 and was bought by google in 2005 
## google 
google gave away android for free to companies so they could develop phones without starting from scratch 
google required android to come with its full suite of applications which led to a fine from the eu 

there were premium models from big companies like motorola and samsung 

## smartphones in developing world 
android started outselling iphone from 2011 
for many people their first computer was an android 
by 2015 apple was selling more iphones in china than the us 
china built a great firewall 

## after iphone:
in 2018 apple announced it would no longer be issuing financial results 
the problem was that phones were getting too good, even 2 year old phones were still more than good enough for most users 
they had more processing power than 1980 supercomputers 
companies started looking for the new device of the future 
smart watches were a possible consideration 
another device are smart glasses with google making the first attempt in 2012 
google didnt officially kill google but it said that it would reorient the product in 2015
