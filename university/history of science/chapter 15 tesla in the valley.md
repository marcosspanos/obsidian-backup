most of the computing power people have at their houses now isnt in a computer or a phone but instead on their car 
computers started being placed in cars in 1970 
they controlled antilock breaking systems, the injection of fuel into engines 
now they control airbags play music give directions and monitor tire pressure 

# silicon valley 
it appeared to be the symbolic heart of a new global order

# one way trip to uncertain future
sectors such as education, health care and journalism were compared to computer technology and were found to be lacking

People were online a lot more which lead to many protests over the death of George Floyd, death by police was nothing new but so many more people were online which lead to them seeing it and being able to organize in numbers to protest

there was an increasing disconnect between fortunes of large companies and ordinary people 

the faith that the internet would lead to free trade and human rights shattered in 2020 
china was a showpiece for the effectiveness of computer technology without human rights
