# personal computers:
electronic calculators became cheaper and cheaper thus allowing ordinary people to start buying them. This meant that for the first time people were able to experiment with a personal computer even though most companies sold these as calculators they were essentially programmable computers 
## expansion and modularity:
altairs were a bare bone kit that people could buy and then add modular pieces later

## microsoft basic:
many people disparaged basic as a toy language that fostered poor programming skills 
Fortran was still widely used for academic work 
Bill gates and Paul allen were already on a path to built a basic interpreter for the altair 

by 1978 bill gates company called microsoft severed the relationship with MITS and was hiring programmers to fill the market with programming languages and system building tools 

## mass market personal computers:
companies took a while to realise the importance of microprocessors
this left the market open for new companies which didnt have any previous experience building computers before such as Comodore and Apple

the most successful of these machines was called the Tandy TRS-080 

there were 3 computers in this era 
1. Tandy TRS-080
2. Comodore PET 2001 
3. APPLE II

the apple one was more expensive that both other ones but it outlasted and outsold both of the other models 

## bulletin boards:
computer users were looking for online experiences 
Bulletin board systems were that experience. the first to go online was the Computerized Bulletin board system and it went online in 1978 in chicago 
boards created a sense of community 

# video games:
many people fist interacted with computers when playing video games

## early arcade games:
the first big hit came with pong a simple two player tennis game released in 1972 
Another atari hit game was called Breakout which moved the bat to the bottom of the screen and added a wall of bricks for players to demolish 

## microprocessor based games:
falling prices of computer components made it possible to pronduce morfe elaborate video games
the boom began with space invaders by tatio 
the success of alien games lead to a lot more similar games such as galaga galaxians astro blaster... 

in 1980 pac man was introduced by Namco 
it was a huge success for pc gaming 

## atari vcs:
this would establish the video game system for home videogaming 
it was the first widely used console designed for plug in cartridges 
although a major success people didnt really want to buy more games which meant atari was in trouble and had to be sold to the founder of comodore who eliminated most of the company 

## computer come home
a well equiped system could be worth as much as a new car 
the true mass market emerged a few years later 
there were a lot of early models of home computers

most home computers were used to play games
