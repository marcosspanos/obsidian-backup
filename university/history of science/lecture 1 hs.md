# random notes:
the authors state that the computer is not as an important technology as the automobile or electricity, they state that this isnt the case as the computer is much newer and hasnt been over many iterations as the other technologies have. 
the computer also relies on electricity so it cant be more important than a more fundemental technology than itself

# first computer:
the first computer is the eniac since it was the first to use both electrical and general use 
this is important since it didnt require a lot of computers for different tasks, a lot of tasks could be done with eniac 

# second computer
the second computer could be considered the edvac since it was built by the same people who build eniac. the major difference is that von neuman came on the team 
von neuman propoosed to use a single memory for both the instructions and the main memory 

the computer has been had a lot of changes over the years 
there is also a rotating drum computer which was significantly cheaper than the high end ones produced by ibm
these were used mostly by smaller companies which didnt have millions and a whole room to dedicate for the most high end computers
