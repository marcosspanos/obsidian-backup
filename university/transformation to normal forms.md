# transformation to boyce codd normal form

input: relation r and a set of fd's for r 
1. compute a canonical set of fd's f 
2. maximize right hand side of the fd's 
3. start with the schema
4. split off violating fds one by one


# transformation to 3nf

2. merge fds with the same left hand side
3. create relations
4. check 1
5. check 2
