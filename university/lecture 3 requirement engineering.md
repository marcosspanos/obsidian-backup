# principles of re:
1. stakeholders
2. problems requirements solutions
3. value orientation
4. shared understanding
5. validation
6. evolution
7. innovation
8. systematic work

the viewpoints and needs of different stakeholders may conflict

we also need to determine where variability is needed

## what vs how 
what implies the requirements 
how implies the technical design 

this is not always true
it is also context dependent 

instead distinguish operationally 
- if a statement is owned by stakeholders it is a requirement 
- if a statement is owned by the supplier its part of the technical solutions


## evolution:
the world evolves so do the requirements so we need to keep requirements stable 
potential solutions
- very short development cycles
- explicit requirement change management 

## innovation:
innovative requirements are key 
strive for making stakeholders happy 

## systematic work:
requirements need to be elicited documented validated and managed systematically 

# main re tasks:
- elicitation 
- analysis
- documentation 
- validation

there is no one size fits all approach for this 
but there are some useful determining factors such as 
- what is the software process
- ability to talk to shareholders
- customer order or developement for market

## information sources:
1. stakeholders
2. context 
3. documents 
4. existing systems

### stakeholders
there are different types of stakeholders
critical 
major 
minor 
we need to determine what groups are each type of stakeholders and assign them the necessary importance

## elicitation techniques:
### artifact based
- background studies
- questionnaires
- storyboards
- user feedback on review platforms
### stakeholder drivn
- interview 
	- there are structured and unstructured interviews 
	- some are both structued and unstructured 
- observation 
	- there is passive and active observation depending if the observer interacts with the people being observed
	- it may reveal tacit knowledge 
	- hidden problems
	- culture specific problems to take into account 
- group sessions/workshops
	- 

these are all important ways to get information regarding the requirements for a software system 


## problems 
incostincies between stakeholders 
- needs and expectations
- terminology 

they dont know their needs
they have a hidden agenda
thinking in solutions instead of problems
