# software quality
this refers to the degree that the software conforms to its requirements and meets the needs of its users

1. the capability of software product to satisfy stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions
2. the degree to which the established requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs wants and expectations 

high quality software meets its requirements which in turn should accurately reflect stakeholder needs
quality is about aligning the software with both its formal requirements as well as true user needs


# error defect failures
## error:
human mistake made by a developer 

## defect
a flaw or imperfection inserted into software due to an error 


## failure 
the termination of the software ability to function as intended 


# quality management
## quality planning 
defining quality objectives, requirements targets and planning of quality assurance 

## quality control 
techniques to measure quality characteristics review work producs and find defects

## quality assurance 
processes to ensure compliance with procedures
## quality improvements
defect analysis and process enhancement

## resources
infrastructure tools, training that enable quality processes

## standards
regulations models certifications that guide quality work

## culture 
values behaviours that encourage quality mindset

## how to control software quality 
- testing software
- static analysis of software
- dynamic analysis of software

# software evaluation:

the making of a judgement about the amount number or value of something
- assesment, judgment, rating

## how to evaluate software
- various points of views
	-  functionality 
	- performance
	- quality 
	- usablity 
	- maintainability 
- various approaches
	- quanitive 
	- qualitivie

# software metrics
## comparability 
- allows comparisons between software systems
- metric values can be compared
## intuitive interpretation 
- concerns what the metric tells you about the system
- a metric should be interpreted also by a non expert in the domain 

## simple and efficient computation 
- compute the metric with little effort 

### examples
lines of code

### tools for software evaluation 
- undersand
- sonarqube


# quality attributes
## performance efficiency 
- represent the degree to which a software performs its function within specified time and effiecient use of resources under specified conditions
- time behaviour
- resource utiliaziation 
- capacity -> degree to which the maximum limits of a software paramete meet requiremetns


## code smells
- indicator of potential issues in the code over time
they are a direct result from bad decicions earlier in the programming journey 

### examples
- large class
- long method
- duplicated code
- switch statement 
- feature envy
