# 3.3 agile project managemetn
in agile project management teams are self organising and there is a scrum master who is responsible for communicating with the client about what is happening

the starting point of any scrum cycle is the product backlog -> list of items which have to be worked on by the scrum team 

most of the items are for features but there might be other items on the list as well 
a sprint lasts about 2-4 weeks 

there are daily meetings where everyone talks about what they implemented and any other feature which are not implemented yet but will be implemented in the future 

this allows for any potential problems to be known to everyone in the team and all are able to workaround them 



# 3.4 scaling agile methods
agile was initially used for small teams 

companies which are using agile methods have seen 15 percent improvement over 3 years

this is not ideal for all companies though 
there are companies which develop embedded hardware and agile method is not ideal due to complexity and having all the systems being very connected with each other 


## agile and plan driven development

to properly scale agile methods you need to integrate them with plan driven approaches

early adopters of agile methods rejected any plan driven methods but companies saw the potential and adapted the methods to their own culture 

to decide the balance between agile and plan driven you need to answer some questions 
1. how large is the system being developed
2. what type of system is being developed
3. what is the expected life cycle
4. is the system subject to external regulation

## agile methods for large systems
large scale systems are much more complex 

there are 6 main factors which are responsible
1. system configuation 
2. system of systems -> they have many parts
3. brownfield systems
4. diverse stakeholders
5. regulatory constraints 
6. prolonged procurument
