# short history 
1968 software engineering terminology 
- objective -> address software crisis 
- motivation -> individual approaches to program development did not scale up to large and comlex systems

new software engineering approaches were developed. 
- structured programming 
- object oriented programming

# software engineering:
## definition:
engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification until maintenance

## main activities
- software specification
- software development 
- software validation
- software evolution


## importance of SE
- software is everywhere
- we rely more and more on software systems



## general issues for software
- heterogeneity 
	- the software needs to work for a lot of different devices
- business and social 
		business and society are changing rapidly. the software needs to be able to keep up with change and change accordingly 
- security trust and privacy 
		the software need to be secure and private 




## fundementals 
- the software needs a managed and understood development process 
- dependability 
- software specification requirements
- reuse software 

## example software systems:
a software design project
air traffic management
web application for a new university 
lego store

# software engineering 
a structured set of activities required to develop a software system 

## process 
series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end


# descriptions
## activities:
what steps are defined by the model 
## products
which are the outcomes of a process outcome
## roles 
which are the responsibilities of the people involved in the process 

## pre and post conditions
which are the statements true before and after a process activity has been enacted or a product produced 

# types of software process models
## plan driver
- all processes activities are planned in advance
- progress is measured against this plan 

## agile 
- planning is incremental and it is easier to change according depending on the changing customer requirements

# software process models 
## waterfall 
- plan driven 
- sequential activities
- separate and distinct activities

establishes the required functionality and constraints on the software operation and development 

this process designs a system which meets the requirement specification
it translates the requirement specification into a solution 

### implementation:
translate the design into an executable program 

observation -> the activities of design and implementation are closely related and may be interleaved

### maintenance and evolution
- solve bugs and other problems
- improve existing functionality
- extend the software with additional functionality


## incremental 
- actvities are interleaved 
- plan driven or agile 

- the objective is to cope with changes
- develop the system in increments
- check each increment before continuing 
- normal approach used in agile methods

- requirements are prioritised 
- the highest priority requirements are addressed in early increments

### limitations:
the process is not visible 
the structure tends to degrade when adding new increments

## reuse oriented 
- software is assembled from existing components
- plan driven or agile 


### examples:
web services
stand alone software systems 


# rapid application development
produce useful software quickly 
based on prototyping 


main idea 
- software is developed in a series of increments
- each increment providesa a new functionality
