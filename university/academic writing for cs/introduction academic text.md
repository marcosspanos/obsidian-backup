# what are academic texts
they are texts which usually talk about something related to academia

# format and structure 
- standard structure, conventionalized 
- references
- boring layout
there are lots of articles so having the same structure means readers can find the information they need a lot quicker 
the sources used are always academic sources 
the format for the source is conventionalized 
# language and style
- formal (complete sentences)
- objective, factual(there is still room for personal opinions) 
- impersonal 
# stories they tell:
- brilliant idea 
- solve a problem 
- overview of research 
- report on an experiment

compare 2 academic articles i find 
will review previous research 

they have impersonal language 
they have references 
the language is formal 
the language doesnt have any time nouns in it 
## exercise 3:

A lot of articles have been published about LLMS, however most people still do not know how they work. LLM's function on the principle of predicting which word should follow the one before it based on mathematical functions which assign a value to a word and try to maximise the score of the complete sentence. 

Despite an increasing number of people using LLMS the majority do not know how they work. LLMS function on the principle of predicting which word is likely to follow given an input sentence. This does not make them able to reason which many people assume they do, rather they are 

Computer Science focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of using computers. There are various levels of abstraction computer scientists use depending on their field of study.Some are working on purely theoretical aspects so they have no interest for practical applications while others are working only on practical aspects. One of the most fundamental problems that computer scientists are always trying to improve is the efficiency of transferring information from one component to another with as few errors as possible.
Many techniques are used for this, such as compression which transforms data into a simpler version allowing us to send the same amount using less bandwidth. 
Another technique is developing new technologies which are able to send information faster such as fiber optic cables which use a thin piece of glass and encode the information using light to transfer it from one computer to another.

Many of the users are university students

are both discussing cyber-security and more specifically how to prevent DDOS attacks. This is important because many bad actors, either individuals or state sponsored organisations, are trying to bring services of essential government websites down.

	Research into cyber security has become vital for many companies in the last 10 years as individuals and state sponsored organisations are developing more sophisticated cyber weapons.Many weapons have been developed, such as viruses, worms and DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack involves the use of multiple compromised systems to overwhelm a website to render it temporarily inaccessible. To counter DDoS attacks various methods have been proposed to prevent and mitigate such threats. Providing a comprehensive and accurate algorithm which detects would have a ripple effect throughout the cyber security especially financial effects for big organisations.  
	Research by multiple authors has been conducted on possible approaches to prevent DDoS attacks. One novel approach is to use machine learning algorithms[1][2] to detect when such an attack is happening.Machine learning algorithms use  Although this has proved effective it still needs to be improved. Batchu et al use a machine learning algorithm with an autoencoder, a type of artificial neural network which can learn from an unlabeled dataset, to better detect a DDoS occuring. Hassan et al use a clustring algorithm which calculates the entropy of the system and determines the impact of active users on the system, if the entropy passes a certain point then the algorithm can be fairly certain that it is a DDoS attack. Both approaches have the potential to become a valuable tool for companies as the new front line against DDoS attacks.As research into these technologies continue they could prove to be a stepping stone for this threat.
