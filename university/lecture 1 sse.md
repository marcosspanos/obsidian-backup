# terminology 
- asset
	- something of value to stakeholders
- threat 
	- circumstance event that could breach security or safety and cause harm to an asset
- threat agent
	- the entity carrying out a threat
- vulnerability
	- a flaw or weakness in a system design implementation operation management that could be exploited by a threat
- impact 
	- the extent to which compromising the security properties of an asset affects achievement of business objectives
- likelihood 
	- evaluation of the chance of a threat scenario actually occuring
- risk 
	- expectation of loss expresses as the likelihood that a threat occuring resulting in impact




# safety vs security 
safety -> natural threat agents
security -> human threat agents


## natural agent
- cant be removed
- unconstrained
- not adaptive
- coincidences are probabilistic 
## human agent
- can be removed
- constrained by cost benefit 
- is adaptive
- coincidences are strategic

# risk management principles
## governance risk management and compliance
- identity threats and risk to your assets
- mitigate those with controls
- deploy the controls
- monitor their effectiveness
- check indicators
- revise periodically 

## risk assessment
- triggered
- new project
- estimate status plan protection roll new protections

identify 
estimate 
evaluate
## risk control 
- on going
- existing activities
- monitor status check metrics react to events
## risk mitigation 
- prioritize treatments
- adopt treatments
## risk acceptance 
- evaluate the residual risk


## what is risk assesment
it is  a process to determine risks that affect organisation operations, assets, individuals
other organisations and even the nation

there are different principles for this
threat based -> NIST UK IAS

asset based -> COBIT , SESAR, SECRAM 


# how to evaluate risks
there are 2 main approaches to risk 
## qualitive 
- employ methods principles or rules based on ordinal levels 
- cant use arithmetic to estimate outcomes just comparisons

## quanititive 
- employ methods based on cardinal numbers 
- can use arithmetics to estimate outcome


# sesar secram 
- build safety and security into system development cycle 
- easy to use for no security experts
- compliant with iso 27005 
- focuses on 2 types of assets


## primary assets
- intangible assets like information or services that is part of the system under analysis and has value to the system 

## supporting assets
 - tangible entities which enable the primary assets
 - they posses the vulnerabilities that are exploitable by threats aiming to impair primary assets

### examples
- hardware
- software
- operating system 
- storage media
- personell


## controls
there are 2 types of controls 

pre event controls 
	they avoid threats occuring
post event control 
	they correct or remediate threats that have already happened

## what can control do:
- reduce vulnerability 
- reduce threats
- reduce impact
