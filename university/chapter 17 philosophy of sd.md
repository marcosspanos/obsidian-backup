# consistency:
this creates cognitive leverage. once you have learned how something is done in one place you can use the knowledge to understand what the other places are doing as well 
Consistency also reduces mistakes
if a system is not consistent then something which appears the same might not be the same after all 
## examples of consistency 
**coding style:**
modern style quides address a range of issues 
style guidelines make code easier to read 

**interfaces**
an interface with multiple implementations is another example of consistency 

**design patterns**
they are generally accepted as solutions to common problems 
if you can use an existing design pattern to solve the problem the implementation will proceed more quickly
