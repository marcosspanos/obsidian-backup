# agile software engineering:
bringing a product to market quickly is critical, 
if you dont there is a chance that a competitor might capture your customers before you do 

## agile methods:
there was a widespread view that the best way to create good software was to use controlled and rigorous software processes 
these one off systems were based on customers requirements
this was called plan driven development 
plan driven development involves significant overhead in planning, designing and documenting the system 

if this was used for small or medium sized companies the overhead would overwhelm them as they are cant handle all the required planning 
to fix this a new method needed to be implemented for smaller companies 

all agile methods are based on incremental development and delivery 

by thinking of software as a set of features with each feature doing something different for the user
with incremental development you delay making something until you cant delay it any longer
the more important features are added first with less important features coming later when there is free time

## extreme programming:
the term was coined by kent breck in 1998 
xp focused on new development techniques that were geared to rapid incremental development

all these are important to extreme programming but it is impossible to deliver all of them at once
development teams need to pick and choose which are the most important for their product 


## scrum:
managers need to know whether a software product is going to be delivered on time and on budget
the problem with up front planning is that details are concrete before implementation begins. this leads to details changing which was not expected
this is why developers of the agile method argued that its better to plan incrementally so plans can change in response to changing circumstances

this didnt really work for the senior management which wanted a more precise understanding of what was happening

this requirement for a more proactive approach lead to the development of 2 main roles
1. the product owner who is responsible for ensuring the development team is always focused on the product they are building and not diverting to other featres
2. scrum master is a scrum expert who is responsible for ensuring the development team uses the scrum method effectively 


the sprint is built on a fixed length period of time which usually 2-4 weeks
the code should be checked reviewd and of good quality
the development team has daily meetings so if someone is stuck they are not stuck for more than a day at a time 
there is a product backlog which has a lot of features which were not still implemented. 
the highest priority one is put on top and is developed first when the new sprint starts


during a sprint the team implements as much of the product backlog as they can 
all unfinished features are put on the product backlog again for the next sprint

the key benefits that come from scrum relate to the product being developed 
the progress of the project and the people involved 

## product backlogs:
this is a list of what needs to be done to finsih the development of the product

they are initially described in broad terms without much detail

items in the backlog can be in either of 3 states shown above 
the product backlog is continually evolving and changing

there are four operations which might modify the product backlog
1. refinment existing pbi are analyzed and refined to create more detailed pbi 
2. estimation-> the team estimates the amount of work required to implement a pbi 
3. creation -> new items are added to the backlog which were not there. these may be new features suggested by product organisers 
4. prioritization-> the pbis are reordered to take new information into account
