to properly develop software you need to have some understading of the system you are developing 
there might be hidden stakeholders which you need to have some knowledge in the area to know that they exist 
re needs to find at least the most basic bugs before passed to the development side 
==modelling is an important task ==

main activities
1. specification -> this is RE 
2. design and implementation
3. validation
4. evolution

the rest are software engineering
## software product development:
in the 70s the software was a one off project since you delivered it and then didnt need to update it 
there is a difference between product and project based based software engineering (check slides)

## product vision:
there are 3 main questions to answer before starting 

## software product management:
focuses on software products that are developed and sold by the business
what features are still pending and all that
need to be in contact with all sides to keep in track how far it is coming along and what needs to be fixed or still be implemented

## agile:
incemental development process 
- frequent releases of the product
- reduces product documentation 
- frequent releases of the product

### extreme programming;

small releases and testing are part of it 
it can be implemented but there are downsides 
some of the aspects are contradictory 

### scrum 
very flexible 
sprints are a key aspect of scrum 

there are self organising teams 
decisions are made by mutual consensus 
coping with team changes is easy 


questions in the end 
- ask users what they want to have in teh system and the stakeholders as well with surveys or find products which are similar and look at what they do and what they do wrong 
- evelop a module to test and find if the requirements are working 
- prioritze the requirements and make sure the ones that are importnat are the ones implemented 
	- the information cant be very detailed 
	- the critical aspects of the product cant change
