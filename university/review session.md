#software-design 
 The clock time of the simulation shall be adjustable before a simulation begins;  
	 this will be done by showing a small window before the simulation where the user is able to type in the time, if nothing is typed then there will be a default value for this field
 The system shall provide a visual (or textual) representation of the ecosystem and a  
mechanism to start/pause/stop the simulation at any time;
	the system will provide a basic visual representation of the ecosystem and to start and pause the simulation there will be a small widget at the top right where the user can press buttons to start and pause the simulation. 
 The system shall collect data on entity populations, environmental conditions, and  
interactions, and provide a log for analyzing and visualizing this data.
	there will be a small window in the bottom right corner which graphs basic data from the population like how many are alive at a given time and the user will be able to switch between them using a simple drop down menu
