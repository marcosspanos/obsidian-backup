# models:
models are very important because managing complex computer systems is impossible without them to provide some abstraction 
choosing the right type of abstraction to use is also very important since choosing the wrong things to abstract will make it impossible to manage the system later when something breaks
there are 3 main characteristics important for modelling
1. mapping: a model is always an image of something. a representation of natural or artificial originals that can be models themselves
2. reduction:a model does not capture all the attributes of the original but instead only those that seem relevant to the user or the modeler 
3. pragmatism:this means orientation towards usefulness. A model is assigned to an original based on the following quetions: for whom, why, what for 

## properties of models:
- abstract-> a model is always a reduced representation of the system that it represents 
- understandability-> it is important to present the remaining elements in the model as intuitevely as possible. This is a result from the expressiveness of the modelling language. 
- Accuracy-> model must highlight the relevant properties of the real system reflecting reality as closely as possible
- predictiveness-> model must enable prediction of interesting but not obvious properties of the system being modelled 
- cost effectiveness-> it must be cheaper to create the model than create the system being modelled

# object orientation:
## classes:
these are used in object oriented programming languages to describe the attributes and the behavior of a set of objects 

## objects 
these are the instances of classes 
an object always has a certain state and can be described by the value of its attributes at any given time 

## polymorphism:
this is the ability to adopt different forms 
a polymorphic attribute can have references to objects from different classes
