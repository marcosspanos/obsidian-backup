# new approach:

The internet has grown from a service which a few people were fortunate enough to use to something we are dependent everyday for our personal lives. Although this has enormous positive effects, a downside that is often overlooked is how internet connected devices are a new way for hackers to gain access to our devices. This trend has been especially dangerous with IoT devices which are designed by small companies and do not receive proper software support leaving them undefended by many threats which would normally not be a problem if software support was up to date. Normally devices do not store data which needs to be protected as they are only used to turn on and off lights or control the blinds. But recently a new trend is to use wearables smart devices to monitor the patients health, these devices keep sensitive information about the patient and they are also in very high risk of attack since they are not properly defended. 
The two research papers discussed here aim to mitigate this security risk by using authentication mechanisms. Both studies propose the adoption of multifactor authentication (MFA) instead of relying solely on traditional username-password combinations.
The first paper aims to use the Ethereum blockchain as a distributed database and also uses a password a qr code and facial recognition to authenticate users. The system is split into three parts, the frontend, the blockchain and the node. The frontend is build using javascript, there are two parts the admin and the user. The admin is able to view and manage all the users while the user is only able to generate QR codes and manage their account. The system redirects the logged in user automatically to the admin panel if they have permission otherwise only the user panel is shown. The blockchain servers as the systems database. Smart contracts are used to facilitate the communication between subsystems and the block chain, to create a user the user's name and photo are required. Lastly the node subsystem is responsible for controlling and allowing users to enter rooms. It consists of a mini computer a camera and a screen. This system is specifically used to secure houses and rooms. It is able to replace the smart cameras we are using with alternative more secure versions which would be harder to bypass since they are not dependent on just a password or a smartphone. Many conditions need to be met for the door to unlock. When the system was tested a parameter which was taken into consideration was the time it took for a new account to be created and for the account to be properly integrated into the system, the total time in theory took 197 seconds and in practice it took a bit over that at 202 seconds. With more research the time required for this procedure will decrease. 
	
The second paper focuses on using multifactor authentication to improve the security of medical health. The difficulty of providing security to telehealth is how diverse devices can be which makes it increasingly hard to secure all of them. It is relatively easy to secure the hospital since securing the servers are all concentrated at one place but securing all of the IoT devices at homes can not be guaranteed as the security at patients house varies. To improve this the authors split the connection sequence of the device to the hospital in four phases. First authenticating the user and the device to the cloud, secondly binding the user and the local device to the patients network, thirdly provide device specific secret to the cloud as credential and lastly revoke the connection of the device at the end of the session to ensure that no one can use the device to connect again.  They proposed an anonymous authentication key agreement for for multi sensor IoT. A lightweight system is used because of the limited capabilities of the edge devices, edge devices have usually limited processing capacity and a significant part of that is used for measuring health metrics. To achieve this the researchers discussed using many different algorithms such as one way functions. They eventually settled on physically unclonable functions, they discussed two different kinds of PUFs, the first one being ring oscillator PUF and the second one arbiter PUF.This ensures that the algorithms can't be cloned which is important as the algorithm provides access to the central server at the hospital. 

Both studies contribute to the growing field of cyber security by demonstrating how multifactor authentication can be leveraged to enhance the security of IoT systems. The first study presents a blockchain-based approach for securing physical access control systems, while the second study focuses on securing telehealth applications through lightweight cryptographic techniques. By addressing the vulnerabilities inherent in IoT devices, these approaches have the potential to significantly improve security in both residential and healthcare environments. There is a lot of research still to be done before these are able to be reliably implemented in every day life but the effects will be positive as it will improve the privacy and security of the data for millions of users.

# 2nd version:
The internet has evolved from a service accessible to a select few into an essential part of daily life. While this digital transformation has brought numerous benefits, it has also introduced security risks, particularly through internet-connected devices. One major concern is the vulnerability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, many of which are developed by small companies and lack proper software support. Without regular security updates, these devices remain susceptible to cyber threats that could otherwise be mitigated. Although many IoT devices perform relatively simple functions, such as controlling lights or window blinds, recent advancements have led to the integration of wearable smart devices in healthcare. These devices store sensitive patient information, making them attractive targets for cyberattacks due to inadequate security measures.
the internet has evolved from a service available only to a select few into a part of everyday life.This has brought numerous benefits to consumers but has introduced security risks. One major concert is the vulnerability of IoT devices many of which are developed by small companies which do not offer proper software support for these devices. Without proper security support the devices remain susceptible to cyber threats that could otherwise be mitigated. Although the majority of IoT devices perform simple functions, such as controlling lights or window blinds, recent advancements have created wearable smart devices which are also used in healthcare. These devices store sensitive personal information, making them an appealing option for attackers since they are not properly defended. 




The adoption of IoT devices across multiple industries underscores the urgent need for robust security mechanisms. The healthcare sector, in particular, is increasingly relying on IoT technology for remote patient monitoring, diagnostics, and telehealth services. As these devices handle sensitive medical data, they require strong authentication measures to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access. Traditional security methods, such as passwords, are often insufficient, necessitating more advanced solutions like multifactor authentication (MFA). MFA combines multiple verification methods, such as biometric authentication, QR codes, and cryptographic keys, to enhance security and minimize risks associated with credential theft and hacking.
The rise of IoT devices across multiple industries indicates the need for robust security mechanisms for them. The healthcare sector, in particular, is relying on cheap IoT devices to handle sensitive medical data. These devices handle sensitive medical data so they require strong authentication methods to prevent unauthorized access from third parties. Passwords are often insufficent, more advanced solutions are often required to ensure data integrity, such as biometric authentication and cryptographic keys to minimise risks associated with hacking.






To address these security risks, the two research papers examined in this essay explore the implementation of authentication mechanisms to enhance IoT security. Both studies advocate for the use of MFA instead of relying solely on traditional username-password authentication. The integration of MFA aims to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with IoT devices, making them more resilient to cyber threats and unauthorized access.

The first [1]study proposes a security system that leverages the Ethereum blockchain as a distributed database and incorporates multiple authentication factors, including passwords, QR codes, and facial recognition. The system consists of three components: the frontend, the blockchain, and the node. The frontend, built using JavaScript, includes an administrative panel for managing users and a user panel for generating QR codes and handling account settings. The system automatically directs users to the appropriate interface based on their permissions. The blockchain serves as the database, utilizing smart contracts to facilitate communication between components. To create a new user account, both a username and a photo are required.

The node subsystem, comprising a mini-computer, a camera, and a screen, controls access to rooms. This system offers a more secure alternative to conventional smart cameras by requiring multiple authentication factors rather than relying solely on passwords or smartphone access. It also enhances security by utilizing blockchain technology, which provides a decentralized and tamper-resistant database for storing authentication credentials. During testing, researchers measured the time required to create and integrate a new user account into the system. The theoretical time was 197 seconds, while the practical implementation took approximately 202 seconds. Further research could reduce this processing time, enhancing system efficiency and user experience.

The node subsystem is responsible for controlling access to rooms, it is made up of a mini computer, a camera and a screen. This system offers a securer alternative to smart systems as it requires multiple authentication factors before the the door is open. Using blockchain also enhances security as it is decentralised and more tamper resistant than a single database would be. During testing the practical implementation of the system took five seconds more than the theoretical time calculated. Further research could reduce the processing time and ehnance system efficiency and user experience.  

The second[2] study focuses on securing telehealth applications through multifactor authentication. Ensuring the security of telehealth services is particularly challenging due to the diverse range of devices involved. While hospital servers are relatively easier to protect, securing IoT devices in patients' homes is more complex, as security levels vary significantly. To address this challenge, the researchers propose a four-phase authentication sequence for connecting a medical device to a hospital network. The first phase involves authenticating both the user and the device to the cloud. The second phase binds the user and the device to the patient’s network. The third phase provides a device-specific credential to the cloud, and the final phase revokes the device's connection at the end of the session to prevent unauthorized access.
The second study focuses on securing telehealth applications through multifactor authentication. Ensuring security on telehealth devices is difficult due to the range of devices involved, many are created from small companies which will not be able to support these devices.

The third phase provides a device specific credential to the cloud. The final phase revokes the connection of the device to the cloud to prevent any further unauthorized access

To implement this authentication process, the researchers propose an anonymous authentication key agreement tailored for multi-sensor IoT environments. Given the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, the study emphasizes the use of lightweight cryptographic techniques. The researchers explore various algorithms and ultimately select physically unclonable functions (PUFs) as a security measure. Two types of PUFs are considered: ring oscillator PUFs and arbiter PUFs. These functions ensure that authentication credentials cannot be replicated, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the hospital’s central server.

Both studies contribute to the growing field of cybersecurity by demonstrating how MFA can enhance the security of IoT systems. The first study introduces a blockchain-based approach for securing physical access control systems, while the second study focuses on protecting telehealth applications through lightweight cryptographic techniques. The integration of MFA in these domains highlights its effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with IoT security, particularly in environments where devices handle sensitive information.

Despite the promising solutions presented by these studies, several challenges remain in the widespread adoption of MFA for IoT security. One major concern is the computational overhead associated with implementing advanced authentication mechanisms on resource-constrained devices. Many IoT devices have limited processing power and battery life, making it difficult to implement complex security protocols without affecting performance. Additionally, ensuring seamless user experience while maintaining high security standards is another critical challenge. Security solutions must be designed to balance ease of use with robust protection to encourage widespread adoption.

Another key consideration is the cost associated with deploying MFA-enabled IoT security systems. Small manufacturers and healthcare providers may face financial constraints when integrating advanced authentication mechanisms into their existing infrastructure. Furthermore, interoperability issues between different IoT devices and platforms can complicate the implementation process, requiring standardized protocols and frameworks to ensure seamless integration across diverse ecosystems.

Future research should focus on addressing these challenges by developing optimized authentication algorithms that require minimal computational resources while maintaining high security standards. Researchers should also explore the feasibility of integrating AI-driven security solutions that can dynamically adapt to emerging threats and improve authentication accuracy. Additionally, industry-wide collaboration is essential to establish standardized security protocols that facilitate seamless implementation across various IoT ecosystems.

By addressing the inherent vulnerabilities in IoT devices, the approaches discussed in these studies offer promising solutions for improving security in both residential and healthcare environments. Although further research is needed before these systems can be widely implemented, their potential benefits include enhanced privacy, data integrity, and security for millions of users. As IoT technology continues to evolve, the development of robust authentication mechanisms will play a critical role in ensuring the safety and reliability of connected devices.
