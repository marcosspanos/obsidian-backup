# notes
the cookie yesterday fucked me up but it was really nice as well 
i think i will stop taking them for a while though 
finished a lot of the assigmnents for broader mind course which was nice 
went on a walk with zarina which was quite nice 
im scared i might have made the wrong choice studying at vu but its not like i can really change it right now so i guess there is no point in me thinking about it a lot 
it just sometimes worries me i am not doing what i am supposed to and i dont know if i like it or not
