# overall:
i dont know how trump got the majority of votes
this is actually not something id see again but im pretty sure this just means that we have lost any attempt we had to solve/ minimize climate change 

i need to find some way to be more active 
idk what to do but i need to actually make a difference at this point
i cant just stand back and do nothing this is coming for all of us and i need to remember how i felt when this happened
i really felt lost and i need to do anything i can do to make sure that i can change it even a bit

need to figure how to protect my identity online as well if i will actually do something like this 
i cant risk having done something leak into my actual life so i gotta make sure that i can actually separate everything

its a terrible day today
i hate the world so much
need to find someway to help people out
