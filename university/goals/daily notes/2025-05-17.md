# feelings:

# notes
waking up early was interesting because it didnt feel the way i thought it would feel like. 
I was barely functioning but also there was something nice about being awake while the sun wasnt out yet 
playing tennis was fun but i realized im way out of shape and i need to do something about that soon
had a nap and then cleaned the apartment
giovanis room is making me feel stuff i havent felt in a while
while the words on their own dont really mean a lot the way the book is written makes you feel really vulnerable 
the book club will be interesting
there is something i am missing but i dont know how to put it in words or how to go about in finding out what it is 

whenever i dont have something to do im just trying to find something to do because being alone with my thoughts makes me suffer
