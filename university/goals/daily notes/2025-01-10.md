# notes
the course for academic writing is actually quite nice i didnt really enjoy writing up to this point but i have started enjoying it more and more now 
the history for science course is pretty nice as well but i feel like proffesional development is a joke there isnt really a point to it so far but i guess they want to make sure we have a cv and are ready for when we are looking for a job
