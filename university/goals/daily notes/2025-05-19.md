# notes
today was a nice day at the university i felt like i did a lot of work 
i did go and buy the aircondition which was nice because i will probably need it for the summer/ june

I am not really sure what exam im going to but i hope im atleast able to pass databases without needing a resit for it because that would be bad for me 


# things to remember: 
- apply to university positions
