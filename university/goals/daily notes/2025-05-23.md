# overall:

# group 14:
## cultivation and origins
the choice for this graph is not great as there is no easy way to understand the scale being shown 
-1 
the second graph has too much information in a short space making it hard to understand 

-2 

## global trade and economics 
the choice of graph is good but it is not easy to understand how much each country is exporting and importing 
-1 
the second graph is very good and having some significant events which show why prices drop is a nice addition

## consumption and culture
the first graph is good but having colour as a value representation makes it hard to grasp a value for each country 
-1

the second graph is good 

## environment and ethical impact 
the first graph is out of topic
-1.5

the second graph is nice but i would consider having it in a stacked bar chart instead 
-0.5 

## innovation and the future
this is very interesting
would explain what f1 means 
-2

the second graph is very confusing because there is a really big scale 
-2


 -11 
 
## overall 
the theme seems consistent as it shows how the coffee starts being produced and then tracks its stages
the only one that feels a bit out of topic is the environmental and ethical impact but the rest are really good 
for the last category there could have been an explanation about age of HH head and what they mean since they are not obvious to anyone who hasnt researched this before
(ask if this is the right place)
-5
# group 5 
## cultivation and origins
this is a good graph but there is no indication of what the colours mean for the range in the map

the second graph is good but for most of the countries are all close together which makes it hard to understand how much they produce 

the first graph is good
## global trade and economics
the graph is very confusing ans there is no clear indication between countries 
-2
this holds for all the years which are being shown 



having circles makes it hard to understand exactly the value for each day but it is an interesting graph 
-1 

## consumption and culture
this is a good graph but again the colours are a bit confusing to find out the value each country has
-0.5 

the second graph is really good 
shows clearly when search interest increases  

## environmental and ethical impact
first graph is a very good graph 

second graph choice is not ideal 
it might have been better if you used a bar chart instead because of how much bigger the arrow for coffee is compared to the other beverages
-1 
-4.5 
## overall 
the theme is consistent as it shows how coffee is produced, how much it is sold and then the environmental and ethical impact 
the text aligns with what is being shown in the graphs
there is some cohesion among the themes 
-4

# group 6

## cultivation and origin 
this is a good choice for a graph but having colour indicate the value with such a big range makes it hard to understand what each country's value is
-1

for the second graph it is hard to make it work with 2 scales. This is not ideal as there is a lot of space which is being unused and a different choice of graph might have been better
-2
## global trade and economics 
the representation of the values with circles is not ideal because there is no easy way to find exactly how much the values for a single country is. For some countries the fair trade portion is barely being shown 
-1
the comparison between the fairtrade and non fairtrade coffee is nice but it might have been nice if you could fit the fairtrade inside the non faitrade circles to show the true scale of how much less is being sold 
-0.5
the third graph is quite good

the fourth graph feels a bit redundant as all the information can be found in the previous graph 
-0.5

## consumption and culture
the radar graph is very good with good range and easy to understand

the second graph is also quite good as it is clear for each category how many people fall into each segment, would have been nice if you added a number of how many people it is overall 

very nice heat map 

## environmental and ethical impact of coffee 
the first graph is quite nice and easy to understand

the second graph is again very good and easy to understand with clear value indications

## innovation and the future of coffee 
having 2 scales in a graph is not ideal but the way it is done is quite good 

-0.5
same comments as the last graph 
-0.5 

-6 
## overall 
consistent with what is being shown 
not coherent story 
-5
