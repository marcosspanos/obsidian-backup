# feelings:

# notes

# things to remember: 
woke up super early for no reason apparently this morning 
got a lot of work done before going to the lecture and the workgroup 
need to pay waternet which sucks 
the lecture for re modelling was kinda helpful in that i need to look at the early stuff over again 

# overall:

- pay waternet
- finish notes for lm 
- start thinking about the minor ill do next year
- prepare for new courses in period 6 
-
