Dear proffessor, 
My name is Markos Spanos. I am a second year computer science student. I am interested in applying for a teaching assistant position for your course for next year as I got a (write grade I got) for the course and I found the course particularly interesting. I have experience with teaching other students as I have tutored privately before but I also accepted a teaching assistant position at VU for period 5 for the course data visualization 

Please find attached my CV and my motivation letter. 

Thank you for your time
Kind regards, 
Markos Spanos
