# notes
today i cleaned my house and also did some more work on databases for the exam on friday 
i got rejected from the position at the bank which kinda sucks because i was really hoping i would get it 
i got my money back from the security deposit which was really nice
i met with atlas and we talked a while but we also went to ikea to buy some stuff which was fun 
need to organise a presentation night for ourcampus

# things to remember: 
- finish notes for databases
