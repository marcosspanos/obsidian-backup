# feelings:

# notes
cleaned my apartment quite a bit
had a nice lunch 
did some work on databases
felt immense pressure from being a human with limited time
had a nice time at the presentation event 
had some dinner and then i came home to relax 
drank tea and read a book 
finished the notes for databases

# things to remember: 

# overall:

- finish notes for database
- get snacks for presentation event
-
