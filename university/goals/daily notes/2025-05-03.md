Dear OurDomain 

My name is Markos Spanos. I am currently a tenant of apartment 6261 in OurDomain. I am writing this email to ask whether it is possible to end the contract early as I have I have found a new house. There is a long waiting list for students and young professionals who are looking for a house so finding a new tenant will be easy and you will be able to advertise the apartment earlier. 

Kind regards
Markos Spanos
