# notes
the flight was fine
for some reason all the trains were cancelled as soon as i landed and also all the roads from the airport were also blocked which meant i had to wait for 1 hour at the airport before i could start coming home
my house was kinda messy but at least i had food ready so it wasnt that bad overall
