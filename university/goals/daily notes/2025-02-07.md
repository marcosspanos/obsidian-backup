about me and others;

3. i try to express empathy by allowing everyone to at least fully try to explain their position. Whenever i am having an argument i want to hear the other side fully before i start forming an opinion on their beliefs. While I am not able to do this all of the time it is something I am working on. This is done so I dont start judging too fast and get the wrong image of the person I am talking to 
4. I foster deeper connections by organising events where i get to know people such as movie nights, going out, arts and crafts events. My social circle is pretty diverse as I am actively talking to people from many ethnicities both online and in person. 
5. Last time I actively sought diverse perspectives was when I was trying to figure out a situation with  my friends and I felt like I needed many more perspectives to truly get an objective answer to my question 

## me and society:
i agree partially with it. I think we are biased to see the world in ways we were raised and how we want to interpret events happening but some events can only be interpreted in some specific events such as death 
1. i believe they are very important because all communities consist of individuals so if individuals participate and organise events that means it will be a lot more likely that the community will also participate as a whole, it usually takes a few people to start and then people will also join since the momentum is there and it is a lot easier to meet people 
2. I am trying to be more active in society and fight for social issues I feel strongly about since that means I will hopefully be able to make a change in someway and I hope that means more people will follow me since the more people we are the easier it is to demand change and be heard 
3. I'm not sure what my dream job is yet but I hope my job helps people have more time so they are able to explore their passion. I am interested in computer science so I want to do something which automates activities for people so they are able to have more time for themselves and do activities they like instead of doing something on the computer
