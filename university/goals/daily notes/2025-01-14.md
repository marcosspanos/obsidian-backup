# notes
the class for academic writing was nice , i need to watch the videos about this week but ill probably do that after dinner 
had shieftalies which was really nice, cleaned apartment a bit which was also good 
need to discover more music, there is something about music that i need to figure what makes it so amazing
kinda want to figure out a way to get cheap computer parts and upgrade them for people, that would go hard i think especially for this place since the people here are rich
