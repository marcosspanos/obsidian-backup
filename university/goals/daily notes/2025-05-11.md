# notes
took a walk outside which was quite nicer
got me some food and fruit for this week 
almost done with all asssigmnents until exams come.
read a bit of my book which was nice
made some really nice tea and had a hot shower 
did some cleaning around the house as well as in the shower drain
should look into having my phone be a server somehow
