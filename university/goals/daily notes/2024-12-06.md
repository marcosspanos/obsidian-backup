# notes
 today felt weird cause I have been trying to find a job for about a month now but nothing seems to be working sadly
 need to rethink this probably 
 I am happy that I have been consistently talking to more and more people tho this is great 
life doesnt really feel real anymore 
its all appearing to go to shit which is awful 
going to the wake for gaza was depressing as fuck because hearing the names one by one really changes things
also there was an asshole which started yelling fucking zionist
