# overall feelings:
the event with ndsa was amazing and im glad the people who came to it enjoyed themselves 
might do something else with ndsa in the future 
started playing undertale and while it is amazing it has also made me sad when i had to kill toriel, i hated that i didnt know how to proceed without doing that
also met jasper and we cuddled for a while which was really nice and also watched mr robot and had pizza for dinner which was also really nice, hadnt tried that pizza from jumbo but it is good
