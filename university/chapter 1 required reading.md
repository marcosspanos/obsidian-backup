# software products:
in the beginning there all software products were a one off
companies specified their requirements and then an external company developed the software

this approach was the most common for more than 25 years 
this approach required a lot of time before you were able to start writing code

as more companies automated their systems they needed a software  product but not a custom made one

this meant that the developers where in charge. they decided which features would be added and which platforms would be supported 
## differences between project based and product based 
1. product companies can decide when to change their product or take their product off the market. For custom software developed in a project company the product has a long lifetime 
2. for most products getting the product to customers quickly is critical. buyers are reluctant to change once they have tried something even if a better product comes out later

## alternatives to stand alone products:
1. hybrid products:
	- some functionality is implemented on the user's computer and some on the computer of the vendor that are accessed over the internet
	- many phone apps are hybrid apps with computationally intensive processing offloaded to remote servers
2. service based products
	- applications are accessed over the internet from a web browser or an app. Most computation is done on the company's server 

## product vision:
A product vision is a simple and succint statement that defines the essence of the product being developed
This product vision is used as a basis for developing a more detailed description of the features and attributes of the product 
the product vision should answer 3 important questions
1. what is the product that you propose to develop
2. who are the target users and customers for the product
3. why should customers buy this product 


# software product management:
this is a business activity which is focused on the software products the software products that are developed and sold by business 
software product managers are involved at all stages of product development from initial conception through vision development and implementation to marketing

## product vision management:
while it is ideal for a company to have a pm it is impractical for small companies so most of the time the pm is usually the company founder which requested the new feature to be added. 

## product roadmap:
the roadmap should include a release showing when the different releases of sofware will be out and key features coming out with each release

## user story and scenario development
they can be used to refine a product vision or identify key features which are not yet introduced in the product
the product managers job is to understand the customers and what they would like to have 


## acceptance testing:
process of verifying that a software release meets the goals set out from the pm and that the feature works as expected 
this is also useful to make sure the product is reliable 

## customer testing:
customers or potential customers are asked to test out a product and give feedback for future developments 
they have to ensure the customers are able to use the product and this leads to a lot of useful information for the development team 


# product prototyping:
it is helpful to create an early prototype of the product you 
this is important to 
1. ensure what you are aiming for is feasible 
2. demonstrate the software to potential customers
3. help organise the product and classes for the final version of your product

a prototype should be the first thing you design as it can help with formalising the final version of your product

a short development cycle is critical for this to ensure it doesnt take too long but this also means that there will be corners which will need to be cut 

sometimes prototyping is a 2 stage process
1. feasibility demonstration 
	1. you create an executable system that demonstates the new ideas of your product 
2. customer demonstration
	1. you take an existing prototype and extend it with idas for specific customer features 


# key points:
- software products include general functionality that is likely to be useful to a variety of customer
- in product based development the same company is responsible for deciding on both the features and the implemtation of those features
- software products may be delivered as standalone products running on custoemrs computers, hybrid products or a mix of features implemented locally and over the internet. 
- a product vision needs to shortly describe what is expected. who the target custtomers are and why customers should buy this product
- you should always develop a product prototype to refine your own ideas and to demonstrate the planned product features to potential customers
