# software quality 
refers to the degree that software conforms to its requirements and meets the needs of its users

# software evaluation:
the making of a judgement about the amount number or value of something 
- assessment judgement rating

# software metrics

## comparability 
- allows comparisons between software systems 
- metric values can be compared

## intuitive interpretation
- concerns what the metric tells you about the system 
- a metric should be interpreted also by a non expert in the domain 

## simple and efficient computation
- compute the metric with little effort 

# quality attributes:
## performance efficiency 

- represents the degree to which a software performs its functions within specified time 
- time behaviour -> degree to which the response time and throughput rates of a software when performing its functions meet requirements
- resource utilization -> degree to which the amount and types of resource used by a software when performing functions meet requiremetns
- capacity -> degree to which the maximum limits of a software parameter meets requirements


# code smells and refactoring
this indicates potential issues of the code
they are usually not conforming with SOLID principles

1. Single responsibility 
2. open/closed
3. llskov subsitution
4. interface segregation
5. dependency inversion
spells out solid 

## examples
- large/god class
- long method 
- duplicated code
- switch statement
- feature envy
